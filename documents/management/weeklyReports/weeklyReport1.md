## 1. Overall project status summary

The first week allowed us to create a group dynamic. We have defined the project's scope and the first steps to take. Even if monday was a bit chaotic, we managed to get back on track since thursday and progressed a lot during the last two days.

## 2. Milestones met this week

- ✅ Project setup
- ✅ Definition of the project's scope
- ✅ Project charter

## 3. Timeline status

For the moment, we are on schedule. We have to be careful to keep this pace. Tuesday the 19th is the deadline for the functional specfications v1.0 delivery. We should be on time. \
Nevertheless, we are worried about the hardware part of the project. Some modules are not working yet and we are not sure we will be able to make them work in time.

## 4. Resources status

All the resources we need for the moment are available and working.

## 5. Scope status

The project's scope is defined in a project charter. The scope might evolve depending on the client's needs and the project's progress.

## 9. Team feedback

We feel we have made good progress in this first week. The project seems difficult even though we think it's achievable. The time between each deadline is very short and this is causing stress and a feeling of haste among some members of the team.
