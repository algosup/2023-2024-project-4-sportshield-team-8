# Management Walkthrough
In this walkthrough, we will guide you through the management of our project, providing a recommended reading order for the documents in the management section. This document will also help understanding the documents in the management section and how they are related to each other.

## Recommended Reading Order

### 1. Gantt Chart

The first document you should read is the [Gantt Chart](https://github.com/orgs/algosup/projects/24/views/6) which provides a visual representation of the projecttimeline. This document will help you understand theproject's schedule and the tasks that need to be completed.

### 2. Milestones

Each category of task is associated to a [milestones](https://github.com/algosup/2023-2024-project-4-sportshield-team-8/milestones), where each task completed increases the percentage of completion of the milestone.

### 3. Critical Path

To complement the Gantt Chart, we recommend reading the [Critical Path](add path) document. The critical path is a way to organise the tasks throughout the project. Some tasks need previous tasks to be completed before they can start. The document will highlight the dependencies of each task as well as their planned duration.

### 4. RACI Matrix
After reading the critical path, we recommend reading the [RACI Matrix](https://github.com/algosup/2023-2024-project-4-sportshield-team-8/blob/Documents/documents/management/RACI.pdf) to give you an overview of the project member roles and responsibilities. This document will help you understand who is responsible for what and who should be consulted or informed about project decisions.

### 5. Risk Management Plan

We are committed to having effective risk management
systems (including frameworks and processes) to identify risks and anticipate how to avoid them or limit their impact on the project. The [Risk Management Plan](https://github.com/algosup/2023-2024-project-4-sportshield-team-8/blob/Documents/documents/management/riskManagementPlan.md) will be used to define this strategy.

### 6. Risk Matrix

After reading the critical path, we recommend reading the [RACI Matrix](https://github.com/algosup/2023-2024-project-4-sportshield-team-8/blob/Documents/documents/management/RACI.pdf) to give you an overview of the risks we raised and how we plan to manage them if they occur. It also precise the responsible people for each risk.

### 7. Resource Management Plan

the management walkthrough, reading the [Resource Management Plan]() will provide you with an overview of the project's resource requirements and how they will be managed. This document will help you understand the resources needed for the project, including personnel, equipment, and materials, and how they will be allocated and monitored throughout the project's lifecycle.

### 8. Weekly Reports

To conclude this walkthrough, the [Weekly Reports](https://github.com/algosup/2023-2024-project-4-sportshield-team-8/blob/Documents/documents/management/weeklyReports/) are documents written every week which contain information about what was done during the previous week as well as the current status of the project and feedback about how the team felt.
