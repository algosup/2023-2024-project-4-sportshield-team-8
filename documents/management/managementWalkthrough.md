In this walkthrough, we will guide you through the management of our project, providing a recommended reading order for the documents in the management section. This document will also help understanding the documents in the management section and how they are related to each other.

## 1. Management with GitHub

As we are already using GitHub as a common platform for our project, we decided to use it for our management documents as well. \
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/algosup/2023-2024-project-4-sportshield-team-8/issues) will be used to track tasks and assign them to team members. An issue will be similar to a ticket and each issue will be associated with a milestone. \
The [GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/algosup/projects/24/views/1) feature will be used to create boards that will help us track the progress of the project.

## 2. Recommended Reading Order

### 2.1 Gantt Chart

The first document you should read is the [Gantt Chart](https://github.com/orgs/algosup/projects/24/views/6) which provides a visual representation of the project timeline. This document will help you understand the project's schedule and the tasks that need to be completed.

### 2.2 Milestones

Each category of task is associated to a [Milestone](https://github.com/algosup/2023-2024-project-4-sportshield-team-8/milestones) on GitHub issues, where each closed issue (completed task) increases the percentage of completion of the Milestone.

### 2.3 KPI's

The [KPI's](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U9acaFEGgZtiHfwvuzBhYsWvbLKfg3b1RObZ-7IJ1BU/edit?usp=sharing) (Key Performance Indicators) are used to measure the completion of the project. You will be able to see the progress on each task week by week as well as the overall progress of the project.

### 2.4 RACI Matrix

After taking a look at the milestones, we recommend reading the [RACI Matrix](https://github.com/algosup/2023-2024-project-4-sportshield-team-8/blob/Documents/documents/management/managementArtefacts/RACI.pdf) to give you an overview of the project member roles and responsibilities. This document will help you understand who is responsible for what and who should be consulted or informed about project decisions.

### 2.5 Risk Management Plan

We are committed to having effective risk management
systems (including frameworks and processes) to identify risks and anticipate them or limit their impact on the project. The [Risk Management Plan](https://github.com/algosup/2023-2024-project-4-sportshield-team-8/blob/Documents/documents/management/managementArtefacts/riskManagementPlan.md) will be used to define this strategy.

### 2.6 Risk Matrix

The Risk Management Plan is tightly linked with the [Risk Matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QgjEpX6zDKX6CISM6p01qlBDyDhuG23k/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106192134047636225563&rtpof=true&sd=true). This document is used to list the risks we raised and how we plan to manage them if they occur. It also precise the responsible people for each risk.

### 2.7 Weekly Reports

To conclude this walkthrough, the [Weekly Reports](https://github.com/algosup/2023-2024-project-4-sportshield-team-8/blob/Documents/documents/management/managementArtefacts/weeklyReports/) are documents written every week which contain information about what was done during the previous week as well as the current status of the project and feedback about how the team felt.
