# Management Walkthrough
In this walkthrough, we will guide you through the management of our project, providing a recommended reading order for the documents in the management section. This document will also help understanding the documents in the management section and how they are related to each other.
## Recommended Reading Order
 #### 1. Gantt Chart
 The first document you should read is the [Gantt Chart](https://github.com/orgs/algosup/projects/24/views/6) which provides a visual representation of the project timeline. This document will help you understand the project's schedule and the tasks that need to be completed.
#### 2. Milestones
Regarding the tasks, you can find them on the [milestones](https://github.com/algosup/2023-2024-project-4-sportshield-team-8/milestones), and the percentage of completion is calculated based on the issues and labels.
#### 3. Critical Path
To complement the Gantt Chart, we recommend reading the [Critical Path](add path) document. The critical path is a sequence of tasks that must be completed on time for the project to finish on schedule. This document will help you understand the tasks that are critical to the project's success and the tasks that can be delayed without affecting the project's timeline.
#### 4. RACI Matrix
After reading the critical path, we recommend reading the [RACI Matrix](https://github.com/algosup/2023-2024-project-4-sportshield-team-8/blob/Documents/documents/management/RACI.pdf) to give you an overview of the project member roles and responsibilities. This document will help you understand who is responsible for what and who should be consulted or informed about project decisions.
#### 5. Risk Management Plan
 We are committed to having effective risk management
systems (including frameworks and processes) to ensure
the significant risks we face have been appropriately
identified, assessed, treated, monitored, and reported. Therefore we recommend you to read the [Risk Management Plan](https://github.com/algosup/2023-2024-project-4-sportshield-team-8/blob/Documents/documents/management/riskManagementPlan.md).
#### 6. Mitigation Plan
To complete the risk management plan, we recommend reading the ![Mitigation Plan](add link) document. The mitigation plan outlines the actions that will be taken to reduce the impact of identified risks on the project. This document will help you understand how the project team plans to address potential risks and ensure the project's success. It will also be useful to calculate the risk score, taking into account the probability and impact of each risk.
#### 7. Resource Management Plan
To conclude the management walkthrough, reading the [Resource Management Plan]() will provide you with an overview of the project's resource requirements and how they will be managed. This document will help you understand the resources needed for the project, including personnel, equipment, and materials, and how they will be allocated and monitored throughout the project's lifecycle.
