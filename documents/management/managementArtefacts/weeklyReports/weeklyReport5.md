## 1. Overall project status summary

08/04/2024 - 12/04/2024

This week was the last week of development before delivery. Even though we didn't succeed in fixing the hardware issues, we made a lot of progress on the software part. Unfortunately, we couldn't test it on the hardware but we are confident that it will work. We are going to deliver the project on time but with a reduced scope.

## 2. Milestones met this week

- ‚úÖ Test Plan
- ‚úÖ User Manual
- ‚úÖ Final Product Delivery

## 3. Timeline status

All the deadlines have been met since the beginning, the last milestone is the oral presentation that will take place next Friday. We are confident that we will be ready for it.

## 4. Resources status

After further investigations, here is the status of the hardware modules:
- ‚ùå SIM Module: we don't succeed to make it work but we are not sure if it's a hardware or software problem.
- ‚ùå PCB: we tested the PCB with a multimeter and we found voltage disparity between ports that is probably the symptom of a short circuit.
- ‚ùå NFC: the NFC module is working at the hardware level but unfortunately there is no library compatible with our CPU architecture meaning that we can only use it as an emitter and it's making it useless.
- ‚úÖ Battery
- ‚úÖ Bluetooth
- ‚úÖ GPS
- ‚úÖ Buzzer
- ‚úÖ Electro-magnet: the hardware in itself is working but we can't supply it with enough power to make it work properly.

## 5. Scope status

The remaining scope for next week is to prepare the oral presentation as any changes on the software would not be taken into account.

## 6. Work accomplished

‚û≠ <ins>Documents<ins>:
- ‚úÖ Test Plan: **Thibaud MARLIER**
- ‚úÖ User Manual: **Victor LEROY**

‚û≠ <ins>Software<ins>:
- ‚úÖ Bluetooth securisation: **Thomas PLANCHARD**

## 7. Next steps

- üé§ Prepare the oral presentation

## 8. Anticipated risks

- üéØ Delivered product too light

## 9. Conclusion

To conclude, this week was productive and the final rush was effective. All the deadlines have been met and the milestones have been delivered. The last step is the oral presentation that we are going to prepare next week and the post-mortem meeting that will take either after the oral or after the holidays.
