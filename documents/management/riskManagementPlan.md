## 1. Executive Overview

The purpose of this document is to provide an anticipation strategy for the different risks we could face during this project. This document will also provide a plan to mitigate these risks and a plan to manage them if they occur.

## 2. Risk Gouvernance Structure

A Risk Oversight and Compliance Council (ROCC) will be created to oversee the risk management process and ensure that risks are identified, assessed, and mitigated effectively. \
The ROCC will be composed of three team members. For the general and functional risks, Quentin CLÉMENT, the project manager and Maxime THIZEAU the program manager will be in charge. Whereas for the technical risks, Max BERNARD will be in charge.

For each phase of the project, a meeting will be held to identify the risks that could occur during this phase and to look back at the previous phase to see if the risks that were identified were well managed.

## 3. Risk Identification

To identify the risks that could occur during the project, we will use the following methods:
- Brainstorming sessions with the ROCC and stakeholders.
- Review of historical data from similar projects.
- Research into market competitors.
- Put ourselves in the potential customer's shoes by consulting forums or discussing the product with them.
- Search for known previous problems with the hardware supplied.

The risks will be classified into 
 categories:
- School risks: risks related to the school.
- Team members risks: risks related to the team members.
- Communication risks: risks related to the communication with the client.
- Confidentiality risks: risks related to information leaks about the project.
- Technical risks: risks related to the technical aspect of the project.
- Security risks: risks related to the security of the product.
- Financial risks: risks related to the purchase of hardware aspect of the project.

## 4. Risk Analysis and Assessment

A [risk matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15Px0PwHy_TG3o0VkdEeP_r_7hwcLDHzp/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106192134047636225563&rtpof=true&sd=true) will be used to list and assess the risks. It will take into account the probability of each risk occurring (from 1 to 10), the impact it would have on the project (from 1 to 10) and the risk severity score (probability multiplied by impact). This score will allow us to prioritize the risks and to know which ones to focus on first.

## 5. Risk Mitigation Strategies

For each identified risk, a mitigation strategy will be developed between the four following strategies:
- Avoidance: eliminate the risk by considering alternative that meet project requirements with lower risks.
- Reduction: reduce the probability or impact of the risk.
- Transfer: transfer the risk to a third party.
- Acceptance: accept the risk and develop a contingency plan.

## 6. Operational Risk Management

Operational risk encompasses a broad range of potential issues, from process failures to system outages. Managing these risks is critical to maintaining the integrity and continuity of project operations. \
To address these risks, we have implemented the following measures:

- Regular Back-Ups: we currently upload our work on a GitHub repository as frequently as possible to prevent computer failures that could lead to data loss. \
We also pull from the repository at the start of each project session to ensure that if GitHub goes down, we always have the latest version of the project on our computers.

- Project Privacy: even if the GitHub repository is public, this is a private project ordered by a company. It means that we have to be careful about the information we share outside of the repository. We can't talk about the project on social media or with people who are not part of the project.

## 7. Continuous Monitoring and Reporting

➭ <ins> Monitoring Framework: <ins>

- **Regular Risk Assessments**: Schedule periodic risk assessments to re-evaluate existing risks and identify new ones as the project progresses.
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Ensure regular communication with stakeholders regarding risk status and mitigation efforts, maintaining transparency and trust.

➭ <ins> Reporting Structure: <ins>

- **Incident Reporting**: Establish a protocol for immediate reporting of risk incidents to enable swift response and mitigation of potential impacts.
- **Review Meetings**: Hold quarterly review meetings with the ROCC, project teams, and stakeholders to discuss the risk management plan’s effectiveness and make necessary adjustments.

## 8. Review and Update Process

This document will be reviewed and updated every week to ensure that it remains relevant and effective in managing project risks. \
The [risk matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15Px0PwHy_TG3o0VkdEeP_r_7hwcLDHzp/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106192134047636225563&rtpof=true&sd=true) will be updated pretty frequently to reflect the current state of the project and the risks that have been identified.
