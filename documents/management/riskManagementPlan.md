## 1. Executive Overview

The purpose of this document is to provide an anticipation strategy for the different risks we could face during this project. This document will also provide a plan to mitigate these risks and a plan to manage them if they occur.

## 2. Risk Gouvernance Structure

A Risk Oversight and Compliance Council (ROCC) will be created to oversee the risk management process and ensure that risks are identified, assessed, and mitigated effectively. \
The ROCC will be composed of three team members. For the general and functional risks, Quentin CLÉMENT, the project manager and Maxime THIZEAU the program manager will be in charge. Whereas for the technical risks, Max BERNARD will be in charge.

For each phase of the project, a meeting will be held to identify the risks that could occur during this phase and to look back at the previous phase to see if the risks that were identified were well managed.

## 3. Risk Identification

To identify the risks that could occur during the project, we will use the following methods:
- Brainstorming sessions with the project team and stakeholders.
- Review of historical data from similar projects.
- Research into market competitors
