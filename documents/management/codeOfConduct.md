## 1. Introduction

This document is a management artefact that will define the way the team will work and live together. It will define the rules and the values that the team will have to respect and follow.

## 2. Workload

Because of the short amount of time given between each deadline, workload during project time will be paramount. For each project time, each member will receive an assignment on what they will have to do. \
The goal is to optimise the time given to each member and to make sure that everyone is working on the project.

The strategy will be to prioritise pair programming as well as document writing in groups to mix the points of view and end up with more complete and accurate work.

Everyone will be assigned tasks corresponding to their skills and will be encouraged to ask for help if they encounter difficulties.

## 3. Communication

Communication during project time and online will exclusively be in English.

## 4. Absenteeism

Absence and lateness can happen as long as they are not recurrent and anticipated or at least warned of. As soon as a member knows that they will be absent or late, they will have to warn the team at school or online as soon as possible.

## 5. Sanctions

Those rules are essential to ensure the good progress of the project. If they are not respected, measures will be taken on individual or collective basis. \
In case of a lack of work, the first step will be a warning, and then a report on the work done during the day will be required at the end of each day. If further sanctions need to be taken, the third step will be a report and a meeting with the school.
