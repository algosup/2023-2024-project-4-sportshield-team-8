## 1. Project Overview

The aim of this document is to align the vision of the client and the team. The goal of the project is to improve and optimise the SportShield prototype developed by [Coris Innovation](https://www.corisinnovation.com/).

## 2. Project Scope

### 2.1 Scope

Several improvements have been identified by the client. Because of the short period decicated to this project, the team decided to focus on the following points: 
1. Increase the battery autonomy as well as its lifespan
2. Implement NFC detection
3. Optimize movement detection to make it less sensible but still efficient
4. Change the alarm system to prevent false alarms and use it to alert the user of low battery
5. Add LED's for battery level (nice to have)

### 2.2 Out of Scope

During the first week, we managed to make every module of the hardware work except the GPRS. We assume that identifying the problem and fixing it will take too much time compared to its importance. \
That's why we made the decision to put it out of scope for this project. 

## 3. Project Deliverables

We want to completely refurbish the code provided at the beginning of the project. We fill that its process could be optimised, some lines seems unnecessary and we want to add a bunch of comments to make it easier to understand and maintain. \
A first release will be done on this GitHub repository 

## 4. Project Schedule

The project will be rythmed by deadlines fixed by the client and the school. The milestones for the 
- 18/03/2024: Functional Specifications delivery
- 30/03/2024: Minimal Viable Product delivery
- 11/04/2024: Final Product delivery

## 5. Budget

The budget for this project is limited to the material provided at the beginning of the project. Nevertheless, for some features such as the LED's we might need a small budget to buy the necessary components. \
It will be discussed when the time will come with the client.

## 6. Risks

- **Time**: We only have 5 weeks to complete the project, and might run out of time if we encounter too many problems. \
In this case, we will prioritise the tasks according to the orden defined in [scope](#21-scope).
- **Problem with the provided hardware**: We might encounter problems with the hardware that we won't be able to fix. \
In this case, we will have to find a workaround or change the scope of the project to use the time we have left to work on another feature.
- **Hardware breakdown**: We could break the hardware while working on it. \
In this case, we will try to work with the hardware of another team.

## 8. Conclusion

This document should be approved by us the team, the client and the school in order to all move in the same direction. \
If some of the parties disagree with some points of this document, we will have to discuss it and make the necessary changes to make sure that everyone is aligned.
