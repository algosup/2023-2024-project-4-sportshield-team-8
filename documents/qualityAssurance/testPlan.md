## I. Introduction

### a. Overview

Our team was tasked with upgrading and maintaining an already existing prototype device. This device, made by CORIS Innovation, is an anti-theft connected device. \
We were asked to bring our expertise to the device to improve the overall quality, security, and usability of the device. \
We have to improve the battery's lifespan and optimise its performance, manage the device using the NFC technology, allow multi-threading, and improve the security of the device.

This document will serve to set all the tools and define the strategy for testing the product to make sure that our refurbished device complies with the client's requirements.

### b. Targetted Audience

#### **Primary Audience**

This document is primarily intended for:

- **Quality Assurance**: to comprehend what should be tested, how, the expected result and why. To make sure that the device complies with the client's requirements. To define the stakes of testing and guide the team through tests. To then improve the quality of the final product.

#### **Secondary Audience**

- **Future testers**: to understand our team's testing strategy, what we have tested, how, and the final result. To apply our testing strategy if it complies with what they are testing. To have an insight into our testing strategies to keep on upgrading the product.
