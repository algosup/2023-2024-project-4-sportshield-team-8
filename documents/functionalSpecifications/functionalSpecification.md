### Project scope

This project is more of a maintenance project because we aren't starting from scratch.

As a matter of fact, we were asked to optimize an existing code of the product given by CORIS Innovation but also to add more features such as the NFC or ... 

All these improvements should be done within the deadlines set by the school and respecting the criteria of battery consumption which is really important.

### Timeline

- Planning and Research
  - Learning about the project and preparing it.
  - Week 1
  - 5 half days

- Adding features
  - Adding the NFC, the different level of noises.
  - Week 2 to 4
  - half days

- Tests & Optimizing
  - Reducing the battery consumption and doing the test cases.
  - Week 5
  - half days

- Pitch and support preparation
  - Time reserved for the rehearsal of the final presentation and the creation of the support.
  - Week 6
  - half days

The complete timeline and tasks can be found in the [managing folder](). <!-- TODO -->

### Evaluation criteria

### Risks and assumptions

#### Risks

#### Assumptions

## Personas and use cases

### Persona 1 - Georges Michael

Georges Michael is a 50-years-old man working as a ski instructor during the season.

#### Goals

- Georges wants to secure all the skis of his students when they are doing theoretical courses in the school.
- He also wants to be informed every fifteen minutes of their location to reassure himself.

#### Challenges

- Georges is looking for a simple device allowing him to secure the skis.
- He is searching for a device capable to send him the actual position of the skis during the class.
- He needs a device lasting more than six hours in snowy conditions.

### Persona 2 - Jane Hamilton

Jane Hamilton is a young 24-years-old woman eager to see new landscapes such as mountains.

#### Goals

- Jane wants to go downhill but also to visit the town. She then needs a device to secure her snowboard when she goes in an establishment.
- She is not an enthusiast of smartphone while doing tourism, she wants an audio signal if her snowboard is stolen.

#### Challenges

- Jane needs a device capable of tracking the movement of her snowboard while she isn't using it.
- She wants to activate and deactivate the security easily.
- She is looking for a sonorous security included in the device.

### Persona 3 - Patric Jackson

#### Goals

#### Challenges

## Functional requirements

The main requirements for this project are:

- Optimize the actual code;
- Add a feature for the NFC;
- Check the buzzer's noise level according to the impact;
- Managing the battery consumption so it can last 7 days in cold conditions (6 hours of active mode and 18 in sleep mode).

## Non-functional requirements

## Future improvements

## Out of scope
